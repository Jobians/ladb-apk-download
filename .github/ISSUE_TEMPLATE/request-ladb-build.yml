        ## üì¶ Request a Fresh LADB APK

        Submitting this issue will **automatically build and publish** the newest LADB APK from the official open-source code.

        **‚ÑπÔ∏è How it works:**
        - Checks the official [tytydraco/LADB](https://github.com/tytydraco/LADB) repository for the latest version
        - Builds the APK securely
        - Uploads it as a GitHub Release
        - Shares the download link in the comments

        **‚úÖ No coding required** ‚Äî just click **Create** below.

        ---
        ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
        - Only use this for requesting a **newer version** if one exists.
        - If the latest version is already available, no new build will be created.
        - This process is automated and safe.
